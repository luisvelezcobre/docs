This API provides services to set up, maintain, and manage cobre balance accounts. For this purpose a set of different APIs and endpoints will be exposed so that by using the provided services clients can register accounts and obtain all the previously registered accounts and their corresponding information.

A `delete` endpoint will be facilitated so that accounts can be closed from Cobreâ€™s platform for some providers.
