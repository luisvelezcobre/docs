title: "Approval Process (Maker-Checker)"
---

## Overview

The Maker-Checker process ensures secure and controlled workflows for money movements by requiring approvals for specific actions. This robust process supports both individual and batch-level approvals, enabling flexible transaction management while maintaining high security standards.

## Approval Section

The Approval Section is a dedicated area for managing payment approvals, allowing users to take actions individually or in bulk.

**Features:**

- **View Approvals:** Review payments requiring action.
- **Approve/Decline Payments:** Take action on payments individually or select up to 50 payments for bulk decisions using the checkbox.
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Required for all approval actions.
- **Batch-Level Approvals:** Use the Batches View to manage approvals for bulk payments.

## How Approvals Work

### For Individual Payments

Each payment has an indicator that determines whether approval is required:

- **Creator Roles:** Approval is always required.
- **Admin Users:** Can choose whether a payment requires approval or bypasses it.
- **Payments Needing Approval:** These must be approved or declined by users with the appropriate permissions in the Approval Section.

### For Bulk Money Movements

Approvals for bulk payments are managed at the batch level:

- **Pending Approval Status:** When a bulk payment file is uploaded, the batch and all its associated payments are flagged as Pending Approval unless individual decisions have already been made.
- **Bulk Decisions:** Approving or declining at the batch level affects only payments without prior decisions.

**Steps to Manage Batch Approvals:**
