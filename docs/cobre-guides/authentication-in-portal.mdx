## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
MFA adds an extra layer of security to your Cobre Portal account by requiring a second form of verification beyond your password. It is mandatory for all users and must be configured during the first login.

### Supported MFA Methods

1. **Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP):** Use apps like Google Authenticator.
2. **Passkeys (Coming Soon) üöß:** A passwordless authentication option.
