## How to Initiate a Bulk Payment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Create Bulk Payment'">
Begin by navigating to the money movement section of the portal and selecting the **"Massive money movement"** button.
</Step>
  <Step title="Select a File Format">
  Choose an appropriate format from the supported list or download a Cobre template for guidance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload the File">
  Ensure the file adheres to the following requirements:
	- Valid format and extension.
	- Maximum file size of 15MB.
	If the file fails preliminary checks, such as format or size, an error message will prompt immediate correction.
  </Step>
  <Step title="File Validation">
  After upload, the platform automatically checks the file for:
	- **Required Fields**:
		- Source ID
		- Destination Full Name, ID Type, ID Number (if Destination ID is not provided)
		- Destination Account Type, Bank Code, Account Number
		- Amount
	- **Optional Fields**:
		- Destination ID, Account Alias
		- Description (alphanumeric, 1-40 characters)
		- Reference (mandatory for Mexico, numeric, max 7 characters)
    <Info>
      Validation errors are displayed in a user-friendly modal with detailed feedback. Users can navigate through errors (50 items per page) and re-upload corrected files.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Summary & Confirm">
  Upon successful validation, the platform redirects users to a summary view showing:
	- Total transaction amount.
	- Number of payments.
	- Uploaded file name.
	- A table with individual money movements for detailed verification.
	Users can also download the uploaded file from this view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit or Mark for Approval">
  Finalize the process based on user roles:
	- **Creator**: Batches are marked as "por aprobar" and require approval.
	- **Admin**: Batches are automatically approved unless dual control is active.
	- **Admin with Dual Control**: Approval from another user is required.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Counterparty Creation Logic

Users can:

- Provide a counterparty ID for pre-created counterparties.
- Enter full counterparty details if the ID is unavailable. In this case, the system:
	- Automatically generates a counterparty ID.
	- Uses idempotency checks to avoid duplicates by recognizing existing counterparties with matching information.

This ensures data consistency and prevents redundant counterparty entries.

### Batch List View

After uploading, users are redirected to the batch list view, featuring:

- Status
- Total amount
- Total number of money movements
- File name
- Creation date

Users can search batches by file name, view their details, and navigate to the batch detail view for granular transaction data.

### Roles and Permissions

- **Viewer**: Can view batches but cannot upload or approve payments.
- **Approver**: Can approve or decline batches but cannot upload files.
- **Creator**: Can upload files but requires another user to approve them.
- **Admin**: Can upload and approve batches unless Dual Control is active.
	- **Admin with Dual Control**: Approval from another user is required, even if the admin uploaded the batch.

### Tips and Best Practices

- **Use Cobre Templates:** Reduce errors by downloading and using pre-configured templates.
- **Validate Before Uploading:** Double-check file formats, extensions, and size to prevent upload errors.
- **Leverage Error Feedback:** Quickly correct validation errors using the modal and re-upload files.
- **Verify Transactions Thoroughly:** Use the summary view to ensure all details are accurate before submission.
- **Maintain Counterparty Records:** Use the idempotency logic to streamline counterparty management and avoid redundancy.
