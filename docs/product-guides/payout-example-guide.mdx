## PayOut
<Info>
**Move Movement Type:** BreB Key (CO), Fast Pay (CO), ACH (CO) and SPEI (MX).<br/>
**Countries Available:** Colombia and México
</Info>

### ACH / Fast Pay (CO) _(Recommended)_
The money movement goes from an account of type `cobre_balance` to a counterparty or account of type `cobre_balance`, `checking (cc)`, `saving (ch)` or `electronic deposit (dp)`. _Faster payments that settle almost real-time._
<br/><br/>This type allows money movement between `cobre_balance` accounts / counterparties.

## Additional Features
### Authentication
Cobre's Authentication API is designed specifically for clients to interact with Cobre with the best, most-secured, and frictionless authentication capabilities, in this way, facilitating access to the Cobre Move Money platform. This API simplifies the process of authentication by leveraging a straightforward approach that requires only a user_id and a secret. These credentials, obtained within the Cobre ecosystem, guarantee a secure and efficient authentication pathway.

<Steps>
<Step title="Obtain API Credentials">
Before you can authenticate, you must obtain the necessary API credentials: a user_id and a secret. These credentials are provided within the Cobre ecosystem, ensuring a secure and straightforward way to access the platform.
</Step>
<Step title="Authenticate with the Platform">
With your API credentials in hand, use them to authenticate with the platform. Send a request to the authentication API endpoint, including your user_id and secret. Upon successful authentication, the API will return a JSON Web Token (JWT).
</Step>
<Step title="Refresh Token">
It is very important to implement a token refresh scheme based on its expiration time. This way, you avoid having to update it manually (which is not practical) and also prevent generating a new token every time you call an API (which is inefficient and not recommended).
</Step>
