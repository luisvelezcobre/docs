## Counterparty
A counterparty is an entity, either an individual or a company, involved in a money movement. This entity is critical in determining the direction of the funds in the transaction: 
- When Cobre is sending funds: The counterparty is the beneficiary, or the entity receiving the funds. 
- When Cobre is requesting or collecting funds: The counterparty is the source, or the entity providing the funds. The counterparty must have all necessary information specific to the type of money movement and its geographical context. This ensures the proper execution of the transaction, whether the counterparty is acting as the sender or the recipient of the funds.
